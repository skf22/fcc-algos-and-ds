## freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a repository to keep track of my attempts at solutions for _freeCodeCamp's_ **Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification.

I worked through and completed the certification in 2020, but have decided to go push this repo, primarily as a means of getting some practice (as I have inevitably forgotten quite a few problems) and reviewing my previous solutions, with a view to refactoring where possible.

I will aim to work through 5 problem exercises every day, committing my solutions to the repo as I go: as anyone who is completing/has completed the certification knows, these go from being trivial in the beginning, to becoming incrementally more involved as one progresses.

Anyone who is interested is more than welcome to submit more optimal solutions if they so wish.

It was quite challenging to work through some of these problems, so I'm pleased that I eventually managed to attain the certification:

Below is an overview of the different sections of the certification, with links to the relevant folder. Obviously, these folders will be empty to begin with, and will gradually become populated as I work/re-work through the solutions.
