### **Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String**

<br>

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `var firstName = "Ada"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

**Example**:

```
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
```

`lastLetter` would have a value of the string `a`.

Use _bracket notation_ to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

**Hint**: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
