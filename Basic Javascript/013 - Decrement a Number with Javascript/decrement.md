### **Decrement a Number with JavaScript**

<br>

You can easily _decrement_ or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

```
i--;
```

is the equivalent of

```
i = i - 1;
```

**Note**: The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.
