### **Comparison with the Inequality Operator**

<br>

The inequality operator (`!=`) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "not equal" and returns `false` where equality would return `true` and _vice versa_. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

**Examples**

```
1 != 2 // true
1 != "1" // false
1 != '1' // false
1 != true // false
0 != false // false
```

Add the inequality operator `!=` in the `if` statement so that the function will return the string `Not Equal` when val is not equivalent to `99`.
