### Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

<br>
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
<br>
<br>
`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

Write variable names in JavaScript in _camelCase_. In _camelCase_, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples**:

```
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
```

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use _camelCase_.

Do not create any new variables.
