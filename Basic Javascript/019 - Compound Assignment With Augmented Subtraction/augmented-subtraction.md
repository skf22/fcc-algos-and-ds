### **Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction**

<br>

Like the `+=` operator, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable.

```
myVar = myVar - 5;
```

will subtract `5` from `myVar`. This can be rewritten as:

```
myVar -= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `-=` operator.
