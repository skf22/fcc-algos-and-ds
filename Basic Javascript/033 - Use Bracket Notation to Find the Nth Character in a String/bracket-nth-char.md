### **Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String**

<br>

You can also use _bracket notation_ to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

**Example**:

```
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
```

`secondLetterOfFirstName` would have a value of the string `d`.

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.

**Hint**: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
