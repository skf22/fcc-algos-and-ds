### **Find the Length of a String**

<br>

You can find the length of a `String` value by writing `.length` after the string variable or string literal.

```
console.log("Alan Peter".length);
```

The value `10` would be displayed in the console.

For example, if we created a variable `var firstName = "Ada"`, we could find out how long the string `Ada` is by using the `firstName.length` property.

Use the `.length` property to count the number of characters in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `lastNameLength`.
