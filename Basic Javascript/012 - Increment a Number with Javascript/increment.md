### **Increment a Number with JavaScript**

<br>

You can easily _increment_ or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```
i = i + 1;
```

Note: The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.
