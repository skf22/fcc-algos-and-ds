### **Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String**

<br>

You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the `var firstName = "Augusta"` string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 3]`

**Example**:

```
var firstName = "Augusta";
var thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
```

`thirdToLastLetter` would have a value of the string `s`.

Use _bracket notation_ to find the second-to-last character in the `lastName` string.

**Hint**: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
